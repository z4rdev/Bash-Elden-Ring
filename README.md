# Elden Ring made in Bash
If i see that the people like the game i will continue updating it with new bosses, classes...
I also want to add a Health and attack system because the one that is now i can't even call it a good game.
I want to implement a save, so if you close the game you don't lose the progress.
But i'm not sure if i will be able to do it. At least i will try.

I'm currently working on the UI
